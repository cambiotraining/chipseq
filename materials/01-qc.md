## Quality Metrics

There are several quality metrics that can be used to assess the quality of the ChIP-seq experiment: 

- These are all output by `nf-core/chipseq`:
  - [Complexity curve](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2375)
  - [Fingerprint plot](https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/plotFingerprint.html#background)
  - [Associated fingerprint metrics](https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/feature/plotFingerprint_QC_metrics.html)
  - [MACS FRiP score](https://www.encodeproject.org/data-standards/terms/)
  - [phantompeakqualtools](https://github.com/kundajelab/phantompeakqualtools) - strand-shift correlation, NSC coefficient, RSC coefficient
  - Correlation between replicates and PCA - in the pipeline this is done with DESeq2 (but `deeptools` can do this also)
- Library complexity (https://www.encodeproject.org/data-standards/terms/#library)
  - PCR Bottlenecking Coefficient 1 (PBC1)
  - PCR Bottlenecking Coefficient 2 (PBC2)
  - Non-Redundant Fraction (NRF)


## Consensus Calling

The way the `nf-core/chipseq` pipeline seems to do the consensus calling is the following: 

- Identify peaks in at least `--min_reps_consensus` replicates per group (a group is a combination of antibody + control, I think)
- Then take the peaks across all the replicates for that antibody and take the _union_ of peaks

An alternative to do consensus calling more "manually" is to call peaks only if they are covered by at least X replicates, following [this tutorial](https://ro-che.info/articles/2018-07-11-chip-seq-consensus).
In this case, the simplest way to do it is to find peaks across all the replicates of an antibody. 
This results in  more peaks than `nf-core/chipseq` gives, because it calls peaks if there was 1 rep in vehicle and 1 rep in e2 with a peak. 
Whereas `nf-core/chipseq` doesn't seem to consider that one as a peak (I checked this by loading the BED consensus from the two approaches on IGV). 

In conclusion: the consensus from `nf-core/chipseq` are probably fine. 


- Annotate peaks:
  - HOMER (again)
- Motif discovery:
  - HOMER
